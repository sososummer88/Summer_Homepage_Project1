Code Review for Fang Hong
Reviewer: James Borzillieri

The website is visually attractive, and there was good thought put into the design. There were a few issues though.

-Image references were often missing "alt==" tags. This is important for a few reasons:
  1. Readability's sake. Images do not always have intuitive names. This helps developers keep track of changes to site
  resources and prevents ocnfusion if that resource becomes unavailable.
  2. This helps the user understand what they are looking at in the event of a rendering failure.
  3. Most importantly, this tag is used to help blind people navigate the web. It allows them to interact with the web in a 
     way that would not be achieveable without attention to this detail.
     
-The four images you used on your skills page (Java, Python, SPSS, R) begin to overlap with your tabs past the medium breakpoint.
 Consider a different format (single column) sor smaller screens.
 
 -There are a number of issues that arise on the W3 validator for your site (many having to do with the missing "alt" tags in your image 
  references. See them here : https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsososummer88.github.io%2F
  
Other than that, I enjoyed reviewing your site. Good work!
